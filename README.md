# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

A school district needs to take all standardized high school test data and generate a report that shows the list below.Later in the analysis it was discovered that there was academic dishonesty in the entire grade level in one school.

1. Funding Per Student
2. Budget Per School
3. School Type
4. Average of Reading, Math, and Overall Test Scores
5. The test score breakdown by grade level
6. Top 5 Highest and Lowest performing school.

## Results 

- The school district reading, math, and overall passing averages when down, but the average was not affected. The differences are demonstrated below.
	- Passing Math Difference: -0.1%
	- Passing Reading Difference: -0.3%
	- Overall Passing Difference: -0.3%
	- Average Reading Difference: +1 
- Thomas High School performance was not affected in comparison to the other schools, there are still ranked in the top 5 schools in the district.
	- Math and reading scores by grade: The alteration does put them in the bottom in math and reading scores for ninth graders, but the other grades are not afftected.  
	- Scores by school spending: Little to no affect on the scores presented
	- Scores by school size: Little to no affect on the scores presented 
	- Scores by school type: Little to no affect on the scores presented

## Summary

Correcting the ninth graders' reading and math scores most impact was the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, but it did not affect the rest of the school's representation because the other grades (10th -12th) score higher than average. This could potentially affect the school funding for the 9th grade as well as the school in the future if this were to happen again. In addition to the lack of data for the ninth grade at Thomas High School, is the way that they log and store grades for the entire district might be under scruity as well.
